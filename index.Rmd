```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\bethb\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\GitHub DataViz\\theRealDelivrable2")
movieData <- read.csv("Best_Movie_by_Year_Netflix.csv")
```



```{r}
str(movieData, width=50, strict.width='cut')
```
Tabular data - Bivariate relationship 2: Categorical - Numerical 

Let's keep using the same data on Genres. The next cases will show how a categorical variable can help us better understand the behavior of a numeric variable. 
Let's take a look at a variable that informs the amount 

```{r}
# score report 
# notice the spread of values 
summary(movieData$SCORE)
```
Let me see the crimes that took the longest: 

```{r}
movieData[which.max(movieData$SCORE),]
```

Let's get the median for each Country 

```{r}
ScoreCountry=movieData[complete.cases(movieData),]
aggregate(data = ScoreCountry, SCORE~MAIN_PRODUCTION,median)
```

Let's request a boxplot for each country

```{r}
# boxplot of score per country

library(ggplot2)
base=ggplot(data = ScoreCountry,
            aes(x = MAIN_PRODUCTION, y=SCORE))

base + geom_boxplot()
```
let's check out the statistics behind the median

```{r}
# using summary function 
tapply(ScoreCountry$SCORE,
       ScoreCountry$MAIN_PRODUCTION, summary)
```
If we consider the situation of score > 7 is expected behavior, let me keep the ones that are > 7 using ggarrange

```{r}
library(ggpubr)

base7 = ggplot(data = ScoreCountry[ScoreCountry$SCORE >= 7,],
               aes(x=MAIN_PRODUCTION, y=SCORE))
box7 = base7 + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "7 and above")

base8 = ggplot(data = ScoreCountry[ScoreCountry$SCORE >= 8,],
               aes(x = MAIN_PRODUCTION, y = SCORE))
box8 = base8 + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "8 and above")

base9 = ggplot(data = ScoreCountry[ScoreCountry$SCORE >= 9,],
               aes(x = MAIN_PRODUCTION, y = SCORE))
box9 = base9 + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "9 and above")

# all in one
ggarrange(box7, box8, box9, ncol=1)
```

Up to this point, you need to be planning a good story. The situation is different for each case, but let's build our visual from the crimes that take a year or longer to report

```{r}
ScoreAbove7 = ScoreCountry[ScoreCountry$SCORE >= 7,]
```

Let's see if flipping helps you see better

```{r}
titleText = "Countries Movie Scores Above 7.0"

names(ScoreAbove7)=c("Index","Title","Release Year", "Score", "Genre", "Country")
baseSA7 = ggplot(data = ScoreAbove7,
                 aes(x = Country,
                     y = Score))

boxSA7 = baseSA7 + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = titleText)

boxSA7 + coord_flip()
```

Let's reorder the category by median of the numeric variable 

```{r}
baseSA7 = ggplot(data = ScoreAbove7,
                 aes(x = reorder(Country, Score, median),
                     y = Score))
boxSA7 = baseSA7 + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = titleText)

# flipping
boxSA7 + coord_flip()
```
What if we use the histogram: 

```{r}
baseHistSA7 = ggplot(data = ScoreAbove7,
                     aes(x = Score))
HistSA7 = baseHistSA7 + geom_histogram(aes(fill=Country),
                                       color = 'black') # color the border
HistSA7
```

You need facets: 

```{r}
HistSA7 + facet_grid(~Country)
```
The alternative without legend

```{r}
HistSA7 + facet_grid(Country~.) + guides(fill="none")
```
What about reordering 

```{r}
HistSA7 = HistSA7 + facet_grid(reorder(Country,
                                       -Score,
                                       mean)~.) + guides(fill="none")
HistSA7
```
```{r}
titleText2 = "Which Countries Produced the Highest Rated Netflix Movies?"
HistSA7.1 = HistSA7 + labs(title = titleText2)
HistSA7.1
```

```{r}
sourceText = 'Source: Eduardo Gonzalez'
HistSA7.2 = ggplot(transform(ScoreCountry,
                 CountryH=factor(MAIN_PRODUCTION, levels = c("US", "IN", "GB", "HK", "JP", "FR", "DE")))) + geom_histogram(aes(SCORE), fill='darkgreen')+facet_grid(CountryH~.)

HistSA7.3 = HistSA7.2 + labs(title = titleText2, x = "movie score", y = "number of movies per score", caption = c('Source: Eduardo Gonzalez','Countries: United States, India, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Japan, France, Denmark'))
                             
HistSA7.4 = HistSA7.3 + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   size = 5)) +  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=c(0,1), size = 6),plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) 

HistSA7.4

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
